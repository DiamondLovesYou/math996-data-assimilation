# Data Assimilation (WIP)

This is Richard Diamond's implementation of a few discrete time data
assimilation routines in Rust. These are derived from Data Assimilation: A
Mathematical Introduction (DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-20325-6) by
Law-Stuart-Zygalakis.

To build, you'll need at least: Rust (recommend using
`rustup`), Cargo, and a system installation of a LAPACK 
and BLAS library. To run, ie, `p13`:
`cd book-problems/p13 && cargo run --release`.

I'm happy to answer questions in class or by email:
